.Sh NAME
.Nm khttp_body ,
.Nm khttp_body_compress
.Nd close the HTTP header sequence for kcgi
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.Ft int
.Fo khttp_body
.Fa "struct kreq *req"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo khttp_body_compress
.Fa "struct kreq *req"
.Fa "int compress"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn khttp_body
and
.Fn khttp_body_compress
functions terminate the zero or more
.Xr khttp_head 3
calls for a
.Xr kcgi 3
context
.Fa req .
After these functions, invoking
.Xr khttp_head 3
or invoking
.Fn khttp_body
or
.Fn khttp_body_compress
again results in undefined behaviour.
.Pp
The
.Fa compress
argument enables or disables compression as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It >0
Check whether the
.Dq Accept-Encoding
request header specified
.Dq gzip
with a non-zero or empty q-value.
If so, emit the appropriate
.Dq Content-Encoding
header and try to enable write compression.
Calling
.Fn khttp_body
also selects this auto-compression behaviour.
.It 0
Do not check for the request header and do not emit
.Dq Content-Encoding ,
but try to enable write compression anyway.
This is useful for applications that write the
.Dq Content-Encoding
header themselves and want to explicitly stipulate output compression.
.It <0
Simply open the document body: do not fiddle with compression at all.
This is useful if the application requires complete control over the
output stream.
Calls to
.Xr khttp_write 3
will be uncompressed.
.El
.Pp
If
.Xr kcgi 3
is not built with
.Xr zlib 3
support, compression is never enabled regardless the argument to
.Fn khttp_body_compress .
If
.Xr zlib 3
fails when enabling compression, the error is reported and compression
is disabled.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both functions return non-zero if subsequent calls to
.Xr khttp_write 3
and similar functions will use compression, or 0 otherwise.
