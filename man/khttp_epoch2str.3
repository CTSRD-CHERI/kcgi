.Sh NAME

.Nd convert time to a string
.Sh LIBRARY

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.Ft void
.Fo khttp_epoch2str

.Fa "size_t sz"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Format an
.Fa epoch
value
.Pq seconds since Jan 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
into the buffer
.Fa buf
of size
.Fa sz ,
which should be greater than or equal to 32 bytes.
For years greater than 4 digits, more space may be required, but callers
should in practice limit themselves to 4 digit years.
If not enough space is given for the formatted date, the buffer is
truncated to the available size.
It is always NUL-terminated.
If
.Fa buf
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fa sz
is zero, or time conversion fails, these return
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The output of
.Fn khttp_epoch2str
conforms to RFC 5322:
.Li Wed, 02 Oct 2002 13:00:00 GMT .
However, the year may be greater than four digits or less than 1900,
or even be negative, which is contrary to RFC 5322 section 3.3.
.Pp
.Fn khttp_epoch2ustr
conforms to ISO 8601:
.Li 2002-10-02T13:00:00Z ,
again with the stipulation that the year may be greater than 4 digits or
be less than zero.
.Pp
These deprecate the original
.Fn kutil_epoch2str
and
.Fn kutil_epoch2utcstr
functions, which had undefined behaviour in some corner cases.

.Sh CAVEATS
Not all systems support 64-bit integer time, so the input might be
silently truncated when casting to
.Vt time_t .
.Pp
A negative year or year with more than 4 digits will confuse most
software.
