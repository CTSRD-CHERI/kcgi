.Sh DESCRIPTION
Format an
.Fa epoch
value
.Pq seconds since Jan 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
into its broken-down time components.
.Pp
The
.Fn khttp_epoch2tms
function breaks down the epoch value as seconds 0\(en60
.Pq Fa tm_sec ,
minutes 0\(en59
.Pq Fa tm_min ,
hours 0\(en23
.Pq Fa tm_hour ,
day of month 1\(en31
.Pq Fa tm_mday ,
month 0\(en11
.Pq Fa tm_mon ,
year minus 1900,
.Pq Fa tm_year ,
day of week with Sunday at 0
.Pq Fa tm_wday ,
and day of year 0\(en365
.Pq Fa tm_yday .
If any of the pointers are
.Dv NULL ,
they are ignored.
.Pp
The
.Fn KHTTP_EPOCH2TM
macro fills in
.Fa tm
with the above values.
Other fields in the
.Vt "struct tm"
structure, like
.Va tm_gmtoff ,
are not touched.
.Pp
These deprecate the original
.Fn kutil_epoch2tmvals
function and
.Fn KUTIL_EPOCH2TM
macro, both of which had undefined behaviour in some corner cases.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These return zero on failure and non-zero on success.
Failure indicates serious system problems.

.Sh CAVEATS
For an
.Fa epoch
in a year beyond
.Dv INT_MAX
or
.Dv INT_MIN ,
the
.Fa tm_year
value is undefined.
